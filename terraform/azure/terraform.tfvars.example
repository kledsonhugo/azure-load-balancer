# Example Terraform variables file
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and set your values

# RECOMMENDED: Use Azure Key Vault for secure password storage
# Uncomment and configure these variables to use an external Key Vault:
# key_vault_name                = "your-keyvault-name"
# key_vault_resource_group_name = "your-keyvault-resource-group"
# key_vault_secret_name         = "vm-admin-password"

# ALTERNATIVE: Direct password (for development/testing only)
# Admin password for virtual machines (minimum 8 characters)
# This password will be used for both vm01 and vm02
# admin_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"
